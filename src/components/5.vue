      What is Oolong Tea?
    </p>
    <p>
      Oolong (Wu-lung) tea originates from China and is actually transliterated from two words meaning “black” and “dragon” in English. Besides its inherent meaning, the two words describe the shape of the oolong leaves in their novel state. Oolong tea goes through a unique semi-oxidization process that ranges from 1% - 99%. Shortly after picking, the leaves are withered and semi-oxidized in the sun then shade dried. After this they are basket-tossed to break down the cells on the surface of the leaves and wok fired, which halts the oxidization process. Heating methods include masterfully hand roasting the tea leaves in multiple steps which generally take place throughout the night. Oolongs are often processed over charcoal or wood which gives a unique flavor to the various finishing styles. Finally, the leaves are curled or rolled into crispy shapes that resemble tiny black dragons, hence the descriptive name. Because oolong tea leaves are more mature, they are harvested later in the spring than green or white teas – usually from late April to early May.

      History of Oolong Tea
    </p>

    <p>
      There are numerous theories about how oolong tea came to be.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first theory, called the “tribute tea” theory, claims that oolong tea stems directly from the Dragon-Phoenix Cake tribute tea, which was made up of two different tea types: “Dragon” (Long) and “Phoenix” (Fong), produced in the Beiyuan tea gardens. When loose-leaf tea came into play as the new way of serving tributes, the name was changed to “Black Dragon” or oolong tea, to associate with the dark, wiry leaves that resulted from this form of processing.

      The second theory comes from the “Wuyi” theory, which claims that oolong tea was originally named after the Wuyi mountain region, where it was first documented in poems from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).

      The third theory comes from the “Anxi” theory, which claims that oolong tea was first discovered in the Anxi region of the Fujian province when a man named Sulong, Wulong or Wuliang, accidentally allowed his tea leaves to oxidize after being distracted during the harvest.

      Oolong teas reached the height of their popularity during the Qing dynasty, with the introduction of Ti Quan Yin, or Iron Goddess of Mercy, to the emperor Qian Lung, who was so enamored by the beauty of the tea that word of it quickly spread. This was also about the time that the gongfu ceremonial method of serving tea came about and played an instrumental role in politicaland modern warfare during that period. Oolong tea was usually served out of special handmade teapots made out of purple clay called yixing teapots. These were designed to be used with one type of tea only in order to season the teapot and avoid cross-contamination of flavors.
