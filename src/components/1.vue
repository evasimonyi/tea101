    Being an engaged crew of tea educators, we have been fortunate enough to receive many wonderful insights on tea from its history to its preparation, all the while diving deeper into the various varietals that stem from the miraculously versatile camellia sinensis plant. While we can’t begin to know everything about tea, we hope that we can help guide you with our extensive knowledge of what we do know about tea in this section.

    We know the importance of building a dynamic learning environment where you have all the tools you need to create your own personal tea journey. In addition to this, we know it is equally important to have a community forum where you have a voice to collaborate and share your ideas about tea and all its wonder. We look forward to your visits and your feedback as we share and discover the many facets of tea together.

      There is a separate category for herbal blends and fruit infusions, which are more properly characterized as tisanes. A tisane refers to a caffeine-free blend consisting of herbs, botanicals and/or fruits prepared like a tea, but technically not a tea. If the drink does not have tea leaves from Camellia Sinensis, it is not a tea. It is most likely a tisane. Therefore, it would be an oxymoron to call something an herbal tea because it can only be one or the other.
