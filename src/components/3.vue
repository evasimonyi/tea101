    What is Green Tea?
    </p>

    <p>
    Green tea, also known as unoxidized tea, is made solely from the leaves of the camellia sinensis plant. The leaves are plucked, slightly withered, then immediately cooked to preserve the green quality and prevent oxidization. As a result of these methods, green teas have a much higher concentration of chlorophyll, polyphenols and antioxidants than other tea types. The growing conditions for green tea can be broken down between two different types: sun grown and shade grown. The leaves are generally harvested three times a year with the first flush producing the highest quality leaves. The heating process differs greatly depending on the region and the tea maker’s techniques. Some of the mainstream methods of manufacturing green tea include:

    Pan Firing - Chinese green teas are often pan or wok roasted to neutralize the natural enzymes then dried, which generally results in a pale green color such as our Dragonwell.

    Steaming – In general, most Japanese green teas are quickly deep steamed resulting in a bright green infusion.

    History Of Green Tea
    </p>

    <p>
    Although written records trace the cultivation of green tea as far back as the Han Dynasty (206-220), when its primary use was medicinal, it wasn’t until China’s early Tang Dynasty (600-900) that we hear of green tea being consumed for pleasure. During this time, green tea was only distributed in compressed cakes for easy transport.

    <p>
    During the Tang Dynasty, there was a groundbreaking book written about the art of green tea drinking called the “The Classic of Tea” or “Cha Jing” by Lu Yu. It is considered one of the most important books of its time because it was one of the first all-inclusive explorations of green tea culture as a whole. It was also during this time that the formal tea ceremony came into being; a ritual, in part due to the tools necessary for preparation, accessible only to the wealthy elite. Because of this, green tea consumption became a symbol of status in society.
